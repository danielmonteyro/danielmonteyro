## üëã Hi, I'm Daniel Monteiro

I'm currently on an exciting journey to become a **Front End Developer**. Passionate about creating interactive and responsive web experiences, I‚Äôm focusing my learning and development around the core technologies of the web: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

To sharpen my skills, I'm constantly building projects that challenge my creativity and help me grow as a developer. I believe in learning by doing, and my repositories reflect that hands-on approach.

Right now, I‚Äôm also starting to explore **React**, aiming to take my front-end skills to the next level with modern, component-based development.
